Your instructor will provide you with login information during the training. This code is _not_ intended to be executed on a learner's local machine.

## Resources

The training references the [Chef Documentation](https://docs.chef.io) to encourage learners to look up information and become self-sufficient in troubleshooting. If the documentation cannot be accessed behind your firewall, you can alternatively access the [chef-web-docs](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs) GitHub page, or the older [Chef12 DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/chef~12/) pages for reference. If none of these are accessible, please make this known to your instructor.
